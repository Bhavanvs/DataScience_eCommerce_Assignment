## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
- **Objective**: Perform exploratory data analysis on the eCommerce Transactions dataset to derive meaningful business insights.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Jupyter Notebook with EDA code.
  - PDF report with at least 5 business insights derived from the data.

### Task 2: Lookalike Model
- **Objective**: Build a Lookalike Model that recommends 3 similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
- **Deliverables**:
  - A CSV file with the top 3 lookalikes and their similarity scores for the first 20 customers.
  - Jupyter Notebook with code explaining the model development.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
- **Objective**: Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques and calculate clustering metrics such as the DB Index.
- **Deliverables**:
  - A report with the number of clusters, DB Index value, and other relevant metrics.
  - Jupyter Notebook with clustering code and visualizations.
